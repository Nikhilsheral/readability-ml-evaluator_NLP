### Project Description: Integrating Readability Formulas and Machine Learning for Evaluating Technical Resources Tailored to Older Adults

This project aims to enhance the accessibility of technical resources for older adults by integrating traditional readability formulas with advanced machine learning techniques. Older adults often face challenges in understanding complex digital content due to cognitive decline and unfamiliarity with modern terminology. Traditional readability formulas like Flesch-Kincaid and SMOG indices assess content complexity but fall short of addressing the unique needs of older adults. 

To bridge this gap, the project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to provide more accurate readability assessments. By considering linguistic features such as sentence structure, word complexity, and contextual relevance, the system offers a comprehensive evaluation of technical resources. Additionally, it generates personalized recommendations to simplify content, making it more accessible and engaging for older adults.

### Key Features:

1. **Enhanced Readability Assessment:**
   - Combines traditional formulas (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog Index) with machine learning models for precise readability evaluations.
   - Utilizes NLP to extract linguistic features like sentence length, word difficulty, and syntactic structure.

2. **Machine Learning Integration:**
   - Trains models using datasets tailored for older adults, considering cognitive challenges and familiarity with terminology.
   - Continuously refines predictions based on user feedback, enhancing accuracy and adaptability.

3. **User-Centric Design:**
   - Provides actionable recommendations for simplifying content, such as reducing sentence length and replacing complex words.
   - Offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload technical resources and receive real-time readability feedback.

4. **Adaptive and Inclusive Approach:**
   - Ensures digital resources are customized to the diverse needs of older adults, promoting digital literacy and independence.
   - Facilitates ongoing improvements by adapting to new language trends and feedback from users.
